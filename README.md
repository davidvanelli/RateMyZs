School Project

Phase 2 - Make the application actually do something. Make the buttons access the accelerometer and record and store the data for analysis. Think of other factors in the sleep grading, like using the micorophone to see if snoring/talking or if they are asleep. 
  
Phase 3 - Create an algorithm for accelerometer data analysis, to give feedback on the sleeping quality.

Phase 4 - Implement the algorithm into the application.

Phase 5 - Assign a feedback system to make it easy for the user to understand how the feedback works. Polish.

Phase 6 - Polish.

Completion - Looks good. Performs good. Feels good.
